\section{Signal Definition} \label{Signal}

\begin{itemize}
  \item QE interactions
  \item 1 proton P > 300 MeV / c
  \item No charged pions with P > 70 MeV / c
  \item No neutral pions or photons
\end{itemize}

Both electron and neutrino samples have been produced with $Q^{2} >$ 0.1. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%    

\section{Strategy} \label{Strategy}

\begin{itemize}
   \item Starting from same number of events (90M)
   \item Scale electron events by $Q^{4}$
   \item Include both CC \& NC for neutrinos
   \item Area normalize No FSI results
   \item Use the same scaling factor for the corresponding FSI result
\end{itemize}
